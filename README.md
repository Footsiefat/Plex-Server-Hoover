# Plex-Server-Hoover

You want some free media but you're a lazy cunt? Well I have the perfect answer for you...

Just set the email of your plex account in plex.py then run it to automatically attempt to access open plex servers and give yourself access to all of their stored media.

**P.S. Don't be a dick and hug these poor servers to death, you have been warned.**
